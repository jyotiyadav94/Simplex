Implementation of the Simplex algorithm with the below problem statement, made as project for the
combinatorial and decision making course's second module taught by Vittorio Maniezzo


A manufacturer company produces wooden tables and chairs ,they have only two resources wood(board feet) and labor
It takes 30bf of wood to make a table and 20 bf of wood to make a chair with the total consumption of wood as 300 bf
It takes 5 hours of labour to make a table and 10 hours of about to make a chair with the total of 110 hours of labor availability
The unit profit for tables is $6 and for chair is $8
And the objective of the comp   any is to get the maximum increase in profit
Here X1 and X2 variables are tables and chairs

Maximize        Z=6X1+8X2       (objective function)
Constraint      30X1+20X2<= 300 (wood constraint: 300bf available)
                5X1+10X2<=110   (labor constraint:110 hours available)
                X1,X2>=0
